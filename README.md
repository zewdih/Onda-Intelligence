# Onda Intelligence

Mission-first coastal cleanup optimization platform.

Onda Intelligence uses drone shoreline mapping and AI analysis to identify high-density plastic zones, estimate waste volume, and optimize expedition logistics before deployment.
It estimates visible vs buried waste, calculates person-hours required, and optimizes ship deployment for Plastic Odyssey expeditions using geospatial analysis.

## What It Does
- Detects shoreline plastic via computer vision
- Estimates waste volume and weight
- Projects cleanup time and crew size
- Accounts for mission blockers (reef access, terrain, vessel limits)
- Optimizes ship capacity planning

## Why It Matters
Cleanup missions often underestimate waste volume and logistics needs.  
Onda Intelligence enables data-driven expedition planning to reduce risk and maximize impact.
